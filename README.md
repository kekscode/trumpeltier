# trumpeltier
A demo how to analyze text snippets in python

* `follower/fetch_timeline.py` fetches twitter user timelines and printing json from the native api
* `storage/save\_to_mongo.py` saves json from fetch\_timeline into mongodb
* `analytics/trumpeltier.py` prints plain text tweets from database to feed into analytics

Some analytics need corpora from NLTK. See [download instructions][1].

## Try

Fetch tweets:

* Start a local mongodb
* Feed the latest tweets from Trump with `./follower/fetch_timeline.py realdonaldtrump | storage/save_to_mongo.py`
* Print all tweets using `python analytics/trumpeltier.py dump`

Analyze tweets:

* `./analytics/trumpeltier.py dump | ./analytics/nltk_wordfreq.py`
* `./analytics/trumpeltier.py dump | ./analytics/nltk_sentiment.py`
* `./analytics/trumpeltier.py dump | ./analytics/nltk_collocations.py`

This should give you - for example for twitter user @realDonaldTrump - this output:

```
$ ./analytics/trumpeltier.py dump | ./analytics/nltk_wordfreq.py
